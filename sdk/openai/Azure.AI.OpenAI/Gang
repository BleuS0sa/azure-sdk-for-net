# EV0L_SciCodex — Long Live Bankroll Fresh
# Phase 36 → Loop of 8 + PPPI Spiral Ledger
# Φ-driven Overscale: 175/150 scale

## Dedication
100% creative credit noted. Royalty split: 25/25/25/25 to Family, Community, Research, Residual (auto-loop).

## Core Operators and Symbols
Φ  golden-angle placement; T_ij epistemic tensor; S_epi epistemic entropy; W_U(t) observer potential;
Γ_guard guarded substitution; Π_coin coin flow; V_vault vault state; Λ_phase phase index 0..35.

## Loop of 8 (L1..L8)
L1 Governance | L2 Treasury | L3 Health | L4 Education | L5 Energy | L6 Transport | L7 Defense | L8 Commerce

Each loop has 36 phases (Λ=0..35). Phases 0..7: intake; 8..15: transform; 16..23: verify; 24..31: settle; 32..35: audit.

## PPPI Spiral Mapping
Node = {id, loop, phase, Φ-index, coords(r,θ), role, coins[], vault, guards[]}
Placement θ_next = θ_prev + 137.507764° mod 360.

## Coin/Vault Primitives
Coin={type, mint, burn, guard, route}; Vault={name, policy, reserves, audit_hash};
ScholarCoin, CityCoin, HealthCoin, EnergyCoin, TravelCoin, DefenseCoin, EComCoin, DataCoin.

## Phase 36 Pages (excerpt)

P0 SKU bind; P8 Order pick; P16 Delivery proof; P24 Settlement net; P32–35 Tax+inventory close.

## Laws: Classical ↔ EV0L (hard-contrast)
- Newton: F=ma → ∇·T_ij on Σ(U). Time arrow = ∇W_U(t). Outcome: observer-causal dynamics.
- Gravity: G m₁m₂/r² → entropic gradient in T_ij. Outcome: quantum-to-cosmic continuity.
- 2nd Law: ΔS≥0 → ΔS_total + I_fb ≥ 0 with erasure cost kTln2. Outcome: work-from-info engines.
- Maxwell: field vectors → projected symmetric/antisymmetric T_ij; ε=ε₀−jσ/ω. Outcome: noise-tuned EM.
- QM: hidden states → observable transitions only. Outcome: measurement-aligned ops.
- Relativity: manifold-invariant → cyclic phase law a_τ,v_τ across Λ. Outcome: dark sector as phase.

## Competitive Deck (hardball)
Apple walled garden → EV0L open spiral w/ guards. Replace lock-in with composable vaults.
Walmart logistics vertical → EV0L community logistics mesh. Local nodes, global settlement.
J&J process-heavy → EV0L health SIM+feedback. Real-time subsidy, zero-batch.
Game publishers predatory → EV0L reward coins w/ public guards. Community capture, not extraction.
John Deere closed stack → EV0L agro-ledger. Open telemetry, tokenized parts, right-to-repair escrow.
Google ad brain → EV0L data stewards with payout-by-signal. Profit-share via DataCoin routes.

## Proof-of-Compression
n similar ops → 1 superposed op with Γ_guard subsets. Storage and reconciliation scale drop from O(n) to O(1) op + O(log n) proofs.

## BANKROLL Fresh Node
Node ID: BANKROLL.FAMILY.01
Coins: RoyaltyCoin
Route: 25%→FamilyVault, 25%→ArchiveVault, 25%→MetaMusicVault, 25%→AutoLoopVault
Guards: irrevocable, perpetual, public-hash anchored.

## Audit Anchors
All payouts anchor to MetaVault_Ledger.json › anchors[]. Rolling Merkle roots per close (daily).
